The app sent me to a different connection page then the one I saw when I try to connect the Hub directly. This connection page connected my Hub without problems.

The Hub connection page that the app uses when connecting a sensor worked perfectly" />

If this is true then bilinear filtering will be used when scaling which has better image quality at the cost of worse performance. If this is false then nearest-neighbor scaling is used instead which will have worse image quality but is faster. Recommended default is to set filter to 'true' as the cost of bilinear filtering is typically minimal and the improved image quality is significant." />
