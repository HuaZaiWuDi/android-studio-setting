      <item value="Whether or not bilinear filtering should be used when scaling the * bitmap. If this is true then bilinear filtering will be used when * scaling which has better image quality at the cost of worse performance. * If this is false then nearest-neighbor scaling is used instead which * will have worse image quality but is faster. Recommended default * is to set filter to 'true' as the cost of bilinear filtering is * typically minimal and the improved image quality is significant." />

      <item value="if the image format is not supported or can not be decoded." />
      <item value="If this is true, then the BitmapRegionDecoder may keep a * shallow reference to the input. If this is false, * then the BitmapRegionDecoder will explicitly make a copy of the * input data, and keep that. Even if sharing is allowed, * the implementation may still decide to make a deep * copy of the input data. If an image is progressively encoded, * allowing sharing may degrade the decoding speed." />
      <item value="This configuration may be useful when using opaque bitmaps * that do not require high color fidelity. *" />
      <item value="This configuration can produce slight visual artifacts depending * on the configuration of the source. For instance, without * dithering, the result might show a greenish tint. To get better * results dithering should be applied." />
