      <item value="This method should set up the request queue needed to initialize the profile. * Enabling Service Change indications for bonded devices is handled before executing this * queue.

      <item value="Device discovery is a heavyweight procedure.

Use {@link #cancelDiscovery()} to cancel an ongoing * discovery. Discovery is not managed by the Activity, * but is run as a system service, so an application should always call * {@link BluetoothAdapter#cancelDiscovery()} even if it * did not directly request a discovery, just to be sure. * &lt;p&gt;Device discovery will only find remote devices that are currently * &lt;i&gt;discoverable&lt;/i&gt; (inquiry scan enabled). Many Bluetooth devices are * not discoverable by default, and need to be entered into a special mode. * &lt;p&gt;If Bluetooth state is not {@link #STATE_ON}, this API * will return false. After turning on Bluetooth, * wait for {@link #ACTION_STATE_CHANGED} with {@link #STATE_ON} * to get the updated value." />
      <item value="The discovery process usually involves an inquiry scan of about 12 * seconds, followed by a page scan of each new device to retrieve its * Bluetooth name. * &lt;p&gt;This is an asynchronous call, it will return immediately.
