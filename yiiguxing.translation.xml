      <item value="Set this to true to enable drawing the labels of this axis (this will not * affect drawing the grid lines or axis lines)." />
      <item value="Set a custom minimum value for this axis. If set, this value will not be calculated * automatically depending on * the provided data. Use resetAxisMinValue() to undo this.
