      <item value="Bitmaps in the pool contain random data that in some cases must be cleared for an image to be rendered correctly. we shouldn't force all consumers to independently erase the contents individually, so we do so here. See issue 131." />
      <item value="An interface for a pool that allows users to reuse Bitmap objects." />
      <item value="Sets some additional data to be mixed in to the memory and disk cache keys allowing the caller more control over when cached data is invalidated. Note - The signature does not replace the cache key, it is purely additive.

      <item value="Compute the horizontal offset of the horizontal scrollbar's thumb within the horizontal range. This value is used to compute the length of the thumb within the scrollbar's track.

      <item value="Like commit but allows the commit to be executed after an activity's state is saved. This is dangerous because the commit can be lost if the activity needs to later be restored from its state, so this should only be used for cases where it is okay for the UI state to change unexpectedly on the user." />
