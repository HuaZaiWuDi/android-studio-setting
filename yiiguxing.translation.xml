These calculations are used to decide which animations should be run. To support predictive animations, RecyclerView may rewrite or reorder Adapter changes to present the correct state to LayoutManager in pre-layout pass. For example, a newly added item is not included in pre-layout item count because pre-layout reflects the contents of the adapter before the item is added. Behind the scenes, RecyclerView offsets RecyclerView.Recycler.getViewForPosition(int) calls such that LayoutManager does not know about the new item's existence in pre-layout.

Where possible, a newly constructed DatagramSocket has the SO_BROADCAST socket option enabled so as to allow the transmission of broadcast datagrams. In order to receive broadcast packets a DatagramSocket should be bound to the wildcard address. In some implementations, broadcast packets may also be received when a DatagramSocket is bound to a more specific address. Example: DatagramSocket s = new DatagramSocket(null); s.bind(new InetSocketAddress(8888)); Which is equivalent to: DatagramSocket s = new DatagramSocket(8888); Both cases will create a DatagramSocket able to receive broadcasts on UDP port 8888." />
