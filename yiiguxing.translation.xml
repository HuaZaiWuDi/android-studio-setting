      <item value="Retry strategy allows retrying a long write operation. There are two supported scenarios: * - Once the failure happens you may re-emit the failure you've received, applying your own transformations like a delay or any other, * aiming to postpone the retry procedure. * - If that Observable calls {@code onComplete} or {@code onError} then {@code retry} will call * {@code onCompleted} or {@code onError} on the child subscription. The emission will be forwarded as an operation result." />

      <item value="Returns an Observable that emits the results of a specified function to the pair of values emitted by the * source ObservableSource and a specified collection ObservableSource." />

      <item value="If any of the sources never produces an item but only terminates (normally or with an error), the * resulting sequence terminates immediately (normally or with all the errors accumulated till that point). * If that input source is also synchronous, other sources after it will not be subscribed to. *" />
      <item value="Combines two source ObservableSources by emitting an item that aggregates the latest values of each of the * source ObservableSources each time an item is received from either of the source ObservableSources, where this * aggregation is defined by a specified function." />

      <item value="Setter for a retry strategy in case something goes wrong when writing data. If any {@link BleException} is raised, * a {@link WriteOperationRetryStrategy.LongWriteFailure} object is emitted. * {@link WriteOperationRetryStrategy.LongWriteFailure} contains both the {@link BleException} and the batch number * for which the write request failed. The {@link WriteOperationRetryStrategy.LongWriteFailure} emitted by the * writeOperationRetryStrategy will be used to retry the specified batch number write request." />
      <item value="the function that acknowledges writing of the batch of bytes. It takes * an {@link Observable} that emits a boolean value each time the byte array batch * has finished to write. {@link Boolean#TRUE} means that there are more items in the buffer, * {@link Boolean#FALSE} otherwise. If you want to delay the next batch use provided observable * and add some custom behavior (delay, waiting for a message from the device, etc.)" />
      <item value="Setter for a strategy used to mark batch write completed. Only after previous batch has finished, the next (if any left) can be * written. * If this is not specified - the next batch of bytes is written right after the previous one has finished. * * A bytes batch is a part (slice) of the original byte array to write. Imagine a byte array of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} where the maximum * number of bytes that may be transmitted at once is 2. Then the original byte array will be transmitted in three batches: * {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4} * * It is expected that the Observable returned from the writeOperationAckStrategy will emit exactly the same events as the source, * however you may delay them at your pace." />
