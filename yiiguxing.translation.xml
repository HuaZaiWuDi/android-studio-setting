These calculations are used to decide which animations should be run. To support predictive animations, RecyclerView may rewrite or reorder Adapter changes to present the correct state to LayoutManager in pre-layout pass. For example, a newly added item is not included in pre-layout item count because pre-layout reflects the contents of the adapter before the item is added. Behind the scenes, RecyclerView offsets RecyclerView.Recycler.getViewForPosition(int) calls such that LayoutManager does not know about the new item's existence in pre-layout. The item will be available in second layout pass and will be included in the item count. Similar adjustments are made for moved and removed items as well." />
