      <item value="Enable or disable interaction with all drawers. This allows the application to restrict the user's ability to open or close any drawer within this layout. DrawerLayout will still respond to calls to openDrawer(int), closeDrawer(int) and friends if a drawer is locked." />
      <item value="Open the specified drawer by animating it out of view. Params: gravity – Gravity.LEFT to move the left drawer or Gravity.RIGHT for the right. GravityCompat.START or GravityCompat.END may also be used." />
      <item value="Like commit but allows the commit to be executed after an activity's state is saved. This is dangerous because the commit can be lost if the activity needs to later be restored from its state, so this should only be used for cases where it is okay for the UI state to change unexpectedly on the user." />
      <item value="Called when the drawer motion state changes. The new state will be one of STATE_IDLE, STATE_DRAGGING or STATE_SETTLING." />
      <item value="Called when a drawer's position changes." />
      <item value="Called when a drawer has settled in a completely open state. The drawer is interactive at this point." />
      <item value="Shows a previously hidden fragment. This is only relevant for fragments whose views have been added to a container, as this will cause the view to be shown. Params: fragment – The fragment to be shown. Returns: Returns the same FragmentTransaction instance." />

      <item value="sizeMultiplier – The multiplier to apply to the Target's dimensions when loading the thumbnail." />
      <item value="Loads and displays the resource retrieved by the given thumbnail request if it finishes before this request. Best used for loading thumbnail resources that are smaller and will be loaded more quickly than the full size resource. There are no guarantees about the order in which the requests will actually finish. However, if the thumb request completes after the full request, the thumb resource will never replace the full resource. Recursive calls to thumbnail are supported." />
      <item value="thumbnailRequest – The request to use to load the thumbnail." />

      <item value="The reason code if there was a wrong password while authenticating." />
      <item value="Start Easy Connect (DPP) in Configurator-Initiator role. The current device will initiate Easy Connect bootstrapping with a peer, and configure the peer with the SSID and password of the specified network using the Easy Connect protocol on an encrypted link." />
      <item value="The reason code if there is no error during authentication. It could also imply that there no authentication in progress, this reason code also serves as a reset value. @deprecated This is no longer supported." />

      <item value="The error code if there was a problem authenticating. Deprecated This is no longer supported." />
      <item value="This class provides the primary API for managing all aspects of Wi-Fi connectivity. On releases before Build.VERSION_CODES.N, this object should only be obtained from an application context, and not from any other derived context to avoid memory leaks within the calling process. It deals with several categories of items: The list of configured networks. The list can be viewed and updated, and attributes of individual entries can be modified. The currently active Wi-Fi network, if any. Connectivity can be established or torn down, and dynamic information about the state of the network can be queried. Results of access point scans, containing enough information to make decisions about what access point to connect to. It defines the names of various Intent actions that are broadcast upon any sort of change in Wi-Fi state. This is the API to use when performing Wi-Fi specific operations. To perform operations that pertain to network connectivity at an abstract level, use ConnectivityManager." />
      <item value="The lookup key for a SupplicantState describing the supplicant error code if any Retrieve with android.content.Intent.getIntExtra(String, int). Deprecated This is no longer supported." />
      <item value="Base class for NetworkRequest callbacks. Used for notifications about network changes. Should be extended by applications wanting notifications. A NetworkCallback is registered by calling requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback), registerNetworkCallback(NetworkRequest, ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback), or registerDefaultNetworkCallback(ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback). A NetworkCallback is unregistered by calling unregisterNetworkCallback(ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback). A NetworkCallback should be registered at most once at any time. A NetworkCallback that has been unregistered can be registered again." />
      <item value="Called when the framework has a hard loss of the network or when the graceful failure ends. Params: network – The Network lost." />
      <item value="Called when access to the specified network is blocked or unblocked. Params: network – The Network whose blocked status has changed. blocked – The blocked status of this Network." />
      <item value="Called when the network the framework connected to for this request returns from a NetworkInfo.State.SUSPENDED state. This should always be preceded by a matching onNetworkSuspended call." />
      <item value="Called when the network the framework connected to for this request goes into NetworkInfo.State.SUSPENDED. This generally means that while the TCP connections are still live, temporarily network data fails to transfer. Specifically this is used on cellular networks to mask temporary outages when driving through a tunnel, etc." />
      <item value="Called when the network the framework connected to for this request changes LinkProperties." />
      <item value="Called when the network the framework connected to for this request changes capabilities but still satisfies the stated need." />
      <item value="Called when the framework connects to a new network to evaluate whether it satisfies this request. If evaluation succeeds, this callback may be followed by an onAvailable callback. There is no guarantee that this new network will satisfy any requests, or that the network will stay connected for longer than the time necessary to evaluate it. Most applications should not act on this callback, and should instead use onAvailable. This callback is intended for use by applications that can assist the framework in properly evaluating the network — for example, an application that can automatically log in to a captive portal without user intervention." />
      <item value="Adds the given transport requirement to this builder. These represent the set of allowed transports for the request. Only networks using one of these transports will satisfy the request. If no particular transports are required, none should be specified here. Params: transportType – The transport type to add." />
      <item value="Set the NetworkCapabilities for this builder instance, overriding any capabilities that had been previously set." />
      <item value="Add the given capability requirement to this builder. These represent the requested network's required capabilities. Note that when searching for a network to satisfy a request, all capabilities requested must be satisfied. Params: capability – The capability to add." />
      <item value="add Capability" />
      <item value="A NetworkRequest as used by the system can be one of the following types: - LISTEN, for which the framework will issue callbacks about any and all networks that match the specified NetworkCapabilities, - REQUEST, capable of causing a specific network to be created first (e.g. a telephony DUN request), the framework will issue callbacks about the single, highest scoring current network (if any) that matches the specified NetworkCapabilities, or - TRACK_DEFAULT, a hybrid of the two designed such that the framework will issue callbacks for the single, highest scoring current network (if any) that matches the capabilities of the default Internet request (mDefaultRequest), but which cannot cause the framework to either create or retain the existence of any specific network. Note that from the point of view of the request matching code, TRACK_DEFAULT is identical to REQUEST: its special behaviour is not due to different semantics, but to the fact that the system will only ever create a TRACK_DEFAULT with capabilities that are identical to the default request's capabilities, thus causing it to share fate in every way with the default request. - BACKGROUND_REQUEST, like REQUEST but does not cause any networks to retain the NET_CAPABILITY_FOREGROUND capability. A network with no foreground requests is in the background. A network that has one or more background requests and loses its last foreground request to a higher-scoring network will not go into the background immediately, but will linger and go into the background after the linger timeout. - The value NONE is used only by applications. When an application creates a NetworkRequest, it does not have a type; the type is set by the system depending on the method used to file the request (requestNetwork, registerNetworkCallback, etc.)." />
      <item value="Create a specifier object used to request a local Wi-Fi network. The generated NetworkSpecifier should be used in NetworkRequest.Builder.setNetworkSpecifier(NetworkSpecifier) when building the NetworkRequest. These specifiers can only be used to request a local wifi network (i.e no internet capability). So, the device will not switch it's default route to wifi if there are other transports (cellular for example) available. Note: Apps can set a combination of network match params: SSID Pattern using setSsidPattern(PatternMatcher) OR Specific SSID using setSsid(String). ANDOR BSSID Pattern using setBssidPattern(MacAddress, MacAddress) OR Specific BSSID using setBssid(MacAddress) to trigger connection to a network that matches the set params. The system will find the set of networks matching the request and present the user with a system dialog which will allow the user to select a specific Wi-Fi network to connect to or to deny the request. For example: To connect to an open network with a SSID prefix of &quot;test&quot; and a BSSID OUI of &quot;10:03:23&quot;: final NetworkSpecifier specifier = new Builder() .setSsidPattern(new PatternMatcher(&quot;test&quot;, PatterMatcher.PATTERN_PREFIX)) .setBssidPattern(MacAddress.fromString(&quot;10:03:23:00:00:00&quot;), MacAddress.fromString(&quot;ff:ff:ff:00:00:00&quot;)) .build() final NetworkRequest request = new NetworkRequest.Builder() .addTransportType(NetworkCapabilities.TRANSPORT_WIFI) .removeCapability(NetworkCapabilities.NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET) .setNetworkSpecifier(specifier) .build(); final ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = context.getSystemService(Context.CONNECTIVITY_SERVICE); final NetworkCallback networkCallback = new NetworkCallback() { ... {@literal @}Override void onAvailable(...) {} etc. }; connectivityManager.requestNetwork(request, networkCallback);" />

      <item value="Returns a new BigDecimal instance with the specified scale. If the new scale is greater than the old scale, then additional zeros are added to the unscaled value. In this case no rounding is necessary. If the new scale is smaller than the old scale, then trailing digits are removed. If these trailing digits are not zero, then the remaining unscaled value has to be rounded. For this rounding operation the specified rounding mode is used. Params: newScale – scale of the result returned. roundingMode – rounding mode to be used to round the result. Returns: a new BigDecimal instance with the specified scale." />
