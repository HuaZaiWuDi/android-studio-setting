      <item value="Binds the current process to network. All Sockets created in the future (and not explicitly bound via a bound SocketFactory from Network.getSocketFactory()) will be bound to network. All host name resolutions will be limited to network as well. Note that if network ever disconnects, all Sockets created in this way will cease to work and all host name resolutions will fail. This is by design so an application doesn't accidentally use Sockets it thinks are still bound to a particular Network. To clear binding pass null for network. Using individually bound Sockets created by Network.getSocketFactory().createSocket() and performing network-specific host name resolutions via Network.getAllByName is preferred to calling bindProcessToNetwork.&#10;Params:&#10;network – The Network to bind the current process to, or null to clear the current binding.&#10;Returns:&#10;true on success, false if the Network is no longer valid." />

It is best to use the alpha property sparingly and transiently, as in the case of fading animations.&#10;For a view with a frequently changing alpha, such as during a fading animation, it is strongly recommended for performance reasons to either override hasOverlappingRendering() to return false if appropriate, or setting a layer type on the view for the duration of the animation. On versions Build.VERSION_CODES.M and below, the default path for rendering an unlayered View with alpha could add multiple milliseconds of rendering cost, even for simple or small views. Starting with Build.VERSION_CODES.M, LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE is automatically applied to the view at the rendering level.&#10;If this view overrides onSetAlpha(int) to return true, then this view is responsible for applying the opacity itself.&#10;On versions Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP_MR1 and below, note that if the view is backed by a layer and is associated with a layer paint, setting an alpha value less than 1.0 will supersede the alpha of the layer paint.&#10;Starting with Build.VERSION_CODES.M, setting a translucent alpha value will clip a View to its bounds, unless the View returns false from hasOverlappingRendering.&#10;Params:&#10;alpha – The opacity of the view." />
