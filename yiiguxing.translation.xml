      <item value="eturns a mutable bitmap with the specified width and height. Its initial density is as per getDensity. The newly created bitmap is in the sRGB color space. Params:" />
      <item value="Bitmaps in the pool contain random data that in some cases must be cleared for an image to be rendered correctly. we shouldn't force all consumers to independently erase the contents individually, so we do so here. See issue 131." />
      <item value="An interface for a pool that allows users to reuse Bitmap objects." />
      <item value="Sets some additional data to be mixed in to the memory and disk cache keys allowing the caller more control over when cached data is invalidated. Note - The signature does not replace the cache key, it is purely additive. Params: signature – A unique non-null Key representing the current state of the model that will be mixed in to the cache key. Returns: This request builder." />

      <item value="Compute the horizontal offset of the horizontal scrollbar's thumb within the horizontal range. This value is used to compute the length of the thumb within the scrollbar's track. The range is expressed in arbitrary units that must be the same as the units used by computeHorizontalScrollRange() and computeHorizontalScrollExtent()." />

      <item value="Like commit but allows the commit to be executed after an activity's state is saved. This is dangerous because the commit can be lost if the activity needs to later be restored from its state, so this should only be used for cases where it is okay for the UI state to change unexpectedly on the user." />

Best used for loading thumbnail resources that are smaller and will be loaded more quickly than the full size resource. There are no guarantees about the order in which the requests will actually finish. However, if the thumb request completes after the full request, the thumb resource will never replace the full resource. Recursive calls to thumbnail are supported." />
