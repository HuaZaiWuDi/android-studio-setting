The resulting Publisher&lt;R&gt; returned from zip will invoke onNext as many times as the number of onNext invocations of the source Publisher that emits the fewest items. The operator subscribes to its sources in the order they are specified and completes eagerly if one of the sources is shorter than the rest while canceling the other sources. Therefore, it is possible those other sources will never be able to run to completion (and thus not calling doOnComplete()). This can also happen if the sources are exactly the same length; if source A completes and B has been consumed and is about to complete, the operator detects A won't be sending further values and it will cancel B immediately. For example: zip(range(1, 5).doOnComplete(action1), range(6, 5).doOnComplete(action2), (a, b) -&gt; a + b) action1 will be called but action2 won't.

Similarly, Throwables signaled by source(s) after the returned Flowable has been canceled or terminated with a (composite) error will be sent to the same global error handler.
