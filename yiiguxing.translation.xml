      <item value="Compute the horizontal offset of the horizontal scrollbar's thumb within the horizontal range. This value is used to compute the length of the thumb within the scrollbar's track. The range is expressed in arbitrary units that must be the same as the units used by computeHorizontalScrollRange() and computeHorizontalScrollExtent()." />

      <item value="Enable or disable interaction with all drawers. This allows the application to restrict the user's ability to open or close any drawer within this layout. DrawerLayout will still respond to calls to openDrawer(int), closeDrawer(int) and friends if a drawer is locked." />
      <item value="Open the specified drawer by animating it out of view. Params: gravity – Gravity.LEFT to move the left drawer or Gravity.RIGHT for the right. GravityCompat.START or GravityCompat.END may also be used." />
      <item value="Like commit but allows the commit to be executed after an activity's state is saved. This is dangerous because the commit can be lost if the activity needs to later be restored from its state, so this should only be used for cases where it is okay for the UI state to change unexpectedly on the user." />
      <item value="Called when the drawer motion state changes. The new state will be one of STATE_IDLE, STATE_DRAGGING or STATE_SETTLING." />
      <item value="Called when a drawer's position changes." />
      <item value="Called when a drawer has settled in a completely open state. The drawer is interactive at this point." />
      <item value="Shows a previously hidden fragment. This is only relevant for fragments whose views have been added to a container, as this will cause the view to be shown. Params: fragment – The fragment to be shown. Returns: Returns the same FragmentTransaction instance." />

      <item value="sizeMultiplier – The multiplier to apply to the Target's dimensions when loading the thumbnail." />
      <item value="Loads and displays the resource retrieved by the given thumbnail request if it finishes before this request. Best used for loading thumbnail resources that are smaller and will be loaded more quickly than the full size resource. There are no guarantees about the order in which the requests will actually finish. However, if the thumb request completes after the full request, the thumb resource will never replace the full resource. Recursive calls to thumbnail are supported." />

      <item value="The reason code if there was a wrong password while authenticating." />
      <item value="Start Easy Connect (DPP) in Configurator-Initiator role. The current device will initiate Easy Connect bootstrapping with a peer, and configure the peer with the SSID and password of the specified network using the Easy Connect protocol on an encrypted link." />
      <item value="The reason code if there is no error during authentication. It could also imply that there no authentication in progress, this reason code also serves as a reset value. @deprecated This is no longer supported." />
      <item value="The reason code if there was a timeout authenticating. Deprecated This is no longer supported." />
      <item value="The error code if there was a problem authenticating. Deprecated This is no longer supported." />
      <item value="This class provides the primary API for managing all aspects of Wi-Fi connectivity. On releases before Build.VERSION_CODES.N, this object should only be obtained from an application context, and not from any other derived context to avoid memory leaks within the calling process. It deals with several categories of items: The list of configured networks. The list can be viewed and updated, and attributes of individual entries can be modified. The currently active Wi-Fi network, if any. Connectivity can be established or torn down, and dynamic information about the state of the network can be queried. Results of access point scans, containing enough information to make decisions about what access point to connect to. It defines the names of various Intent actions that are broadcast upon any sort of change in Wi-Fi state. This is the API to use when performing Wi-Fi specific operations. To perform operations that pertain to network connectivity at an abstract level, use ConnectivityManager." />
      <item value="The lookup key for a SupplicantState describing the supplicant error code if any Retrieve with android.content.Intent.getIntExtra(String, int). Deprecated This is no longer supported." />
      <item value="Base class for NetworkRequest callbacks. Used for notifications about network changes. Should be extended by applications wanting notifications. A NetworkCallback is registered by calling requestNetwork(NetworkRequest, ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback), registerNetworkCallback(NetworkRequest, ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback), or registerDefaultNetworkCallback(ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback). A NetworkCallback is unregistered by calling unregisterNetworkCallback(ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback). A NetworkCallback should be registered at most once at any time. A NetworkCallback that has been unregistered can be registered again." />
      <item value="Called when the framework has a hard loss of the network or when the graceful failure ends. Params: network – The Network lost." />
      <item value="Called when access to the specified network is blocked or unblocked. Params: network – The Network whose blocked status has changed. blocked – The blocked status of this Network." />
      <item value="Called when the network the framework connected to for this request returns from a NetworkInfo.State.SUSPENDED state. This should always be preceded by a matching onNetworkSuspended call." />
