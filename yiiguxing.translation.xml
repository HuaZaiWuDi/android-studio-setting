      <item value="Allows the popup window to split touches across other windows that also support split touch. When this flag is false, the first pointer that goes down determines the window to which all subsequent touches go until all pointers go up. When this flag is true, each pointer (not necessarily the first) that goes down determines the window to which all subsequent touches of that pointer will go until that pointer goes up thereby enabling touches with multiple pointers to be split across multiple windows." />
      <item value="Indicates whether the popup window supports splitting touches. Returns: true if the touch splitting is enabled, false otherwise" />

      <item value="ndicates whether the popup is showing above (the y coordinate of the popup's bottom is less than the y coordinate of the anchor) or below the anchor view (the y coordinate of the popup is greater than y coordinate of the anchor's bottom).

      <item value="overlapAnchor – Whether the popup should overlap its anchor." />
      <item value="Sets whether the popup window should overlap its anchor view when displayed as a drop-down. If the popup is showing, calling this method will take effect only the next time the popup is shown." />

      <item value="true to prevent Target.onLoadFailed(Drawable) from being called on target, typically because the listener wants to update the target or the object the target wraps itself or false to allow Target.onLoadFailed(Drawable) to be called on target." />

      <item value="Sets the listener which will be called for context clicks. Params: onContextClickListener – the listener invoked for all the callbacks, or null to stop listening for context clicks." />
      <item value="Set whether longpress is enabled, if this is enabled when a user presses and holds down you get a longpress event and nothing further. If it's disabled the user can press and hold down and then later moved their finger and you will get scroll events. By default longpress is enabled.

This class should only be used with MotionEvents reported via touch (don't use for trackball events). To use this class:" />
      <item value="The listener that is used to notify when gestures occur. If you want to listen for all the different gestures then implement this interface. If you only want to listen for a subset it might be easier to extend GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener." />
      <item value="Notified when a single-tap occurs. Unlike GestureDetector.OnGestureListener.onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent), this will only be called after the detector is confident that the user's first tap is not followed by a second tap leading to a double-tap gesture." />

This class should only be used with MotionEvents reported via touch (don't use for trackball events). To use this class: Create an instance of the GestureDetector for your View In the View.onTouchEvent(MotionEvent) method ensure you call onTouchEvent(MotionEvent). The methods defined in your callback will be executed when the events occur. If listening for GestureDetector.OnContextClickListener.onContextClick(MotionEvent) you must call onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent) in View.onGenericMotionEvent(MotionEvent)." />
