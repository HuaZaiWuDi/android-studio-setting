      <item value="Sets some additional data to be mixed in to the memory and disk cache keys allowing the caller more control over when cached data is invalidated. Note - The signature does not replace the cache key, it is purely additive. Params: signature – A unique non-null Key representing the current state of the model that will be mixed in to the cache key. Returns: This request builder." />
      <item value="Caches remote data with both DATA and RESOURCE, and local data with RESOURCE only." />

      <item value="Compute the horizontal offset of the horizontal scrollbar's thumb within the horizontal range. This value is used to compute the length of the thumb within the scrollbar's track. The range is expressed in arbitrary units that must be the same as the units used by computeHorizontalScrollRange() and computeHorizontalScrollExtent()." />

      <item value="Enable or disable interaction with all drawers. This allows the application to restrict the user's ability to open or close any drawer within this layout. DrawerLayout will still respond to calls to openDrawer(int), closeDrawer(int) and friends if a drawer is locked." />

      <item value="Like commit but allows the commit to be executed after an activity's state is saved. This is dangerous because the commit can be lost if the activity needs to later be restored from its state, so this should only be used for cases where it is okay for the UI state to change unexpectedly on the user." />
      <item value="Called when the drawer motion state changes. The new state will be one of STATE_IDLE, STATE_DRAGGING or STATE_SETTLING." />

      <item value="sizeMultiplier – The multiplier to apply to the Target's dimensions when loading the thumbnail." />
      <item value="Loads and displays the resource retrieved by the given thumbnail request if it finishes before this request. Best used for loading thumbnail resources that are smaller and will be loaded more quickly than the full size resource. There are no guarantees about the order in which the requests will actually finish. However, if the thumb request completes after the full request, the thumb resource will never replace the full resource. Recursive calls to thumbnail are supported." />

      <item value="The reason code if there is no error during authentication. It could also imply that there no authentication in progress, this reason code also serves as a reset value. @deprecated This is no longer supported." />

      <item value="This class provides the primary API for managing all aspects of Wi-Fi connectivity. On releases before Build.VERSION_CODES.N, this object should only be obtained from an application context, and not from any other derived context to avoid memory leaks within the calling process. It deals with several categories of items: The list of configured networks. The list can be viewed and updated, and attributes of individual entries can be modified. The currently active Wi-Fi network, if any. Connectivity can be established or torn down, and dynamic information about the state of the network can be queried. Results of access point scans, containing enough information to make decisions about what access point to connect to. It defines the names of various Intent actions that are broadcast upon any sort of change in Wi-Fi state. This is the API to use when performing Wi-Fi specific operations. To perform operations that pertain to network connectivity at an abstract level, use ConnectivityManager." />
